# "Attack of the Timelord" for Unity3D

This is a remake of the "Attack of the Timelord" game for the Magnavox Odyssey2 classic console, made in Unity3D. It uses submodules for multiple external libraries, like NaughtyAttributes and EzMsg, and applies a number of advanced coding architecture technique, like Dependency Injection, UI scene separation, Visual Scripted FSMs, ScriptableObject Singletons and events.

Disclaimer: This is a fan-made game developed for educational purposes. That said, feel free to reuse the more-than-simplistic included art in your own projects. 

You're welcome to contribute to the project by creating a pull request. Enjoy.
